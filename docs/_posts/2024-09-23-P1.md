## Setting up the blog

I started th blog using the [chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and following the installation guide that can be found [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).

The only issue while setting it up was that the github actions did not work if the blog was inside the docs directory, so I changed them. This new actions can be found [here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2024-tfg-javier-izquierdo/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml).
