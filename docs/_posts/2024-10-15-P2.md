## Getting the relative coordinates of the survivors

We are given the coordinates of both the boat and the survivors in degrees, minutes and seconds:

* Boat (Start): 40º16’48.2” N, 3º49’03.5” W
* Survivors (Start Search): 40º16’47.23” N, 3º49’01.78” W

As the drone returns the position with the values 0m 0m at the start we just need to calculate the difference between both coordinates.

To do that first we convert those values into UTM to get the distance in meters and the result is:

* Boat (Start): 30N 430492mE 4459162mN
* Survivors (Start Search): 30N 430532mE 4459132mN

As the zone value is the same (30N) the operations needed are much simpler.

```math
east = 430532 - 430492 = 40
```

```math
north = 4459132 - 4459162 = -30
```

So the coordinates in our metric space of the survivors is -30, 40. And using trial and error to get the correct position of these 2 numbers we get the final value: (40, -30)

Also the angle the drone has to used while going to the destination would be: -0.64 rad. And when going back to the start it would be: 2.5 rad

## Moving in a cricles to cover the area

In order to search through the are efficiently I chose to do circles around the known survivors location as represented in the image below.

The radius is increased by 2 meters to have an optimal search path.

As this circular path is generated beforehand when the drone starts to follow it the way to control it is by using set_cmd_pos to the next target in the path.
