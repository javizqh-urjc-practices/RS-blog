## Aligning with the street

This is necessary because if the car is not aligned properly parking would be much more difficult than how it is otherwise.

So in order to align the car with the street I use the following algorithym to calculate the slope of the median line that passes through the obstacles.

1. Convert the right laser values that are not infinite or NaN to 2D coordinates: (x, y)

```python
laser = HAL.getRightLaserData()
points = []
angle = 0

for val in laser.values:
  if not math.isinf(val) and not math.isnan(val):
    points.append((val * math.cos(math.radians(angle)),  val * math.sin(math.radians(angle))))
  angle += 1
```

2. Using the equation of a straight line $y = mx + c$ and as we only need the slope ($m$) as $c$ will be the distance to the line.
3. From that equation, as we have n points, we try to minimize the error for all the points and it becomes the next equation (For more info go to this [web](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/represent-given-set-points-best-possible-straight-line/))

4. Now with the slope found we just compare to check if it is near 0. If it is the we are aligned with the street

## Finding the parking spot

After finding the street orientation and approaching the cars parked to stay in our lane we must find a parking spot to the right of the car.

To do so we have to define the measures of our car. For ours it will be 2.5 meters wide and 5.5 meters long, this measures are a bit bigger than the actual car in order to make sure to find a suitable parking space.

With the car measures and inside our line we can continue going in a straight line checking if there are no obstacles to our left.

When we finally discover such spot we continue going fordward for a couple of seconds (4) before stopping in order to make the parking as easy as possible.

## Parking

Parking is simple, we just need to do it as shown below.

![How to park](https://c.tenor.com/ny3gR42glYsAAAAd/parallel-park.gif)

To do that we make the first turn and the first time we go backwards depend only on time as they will be the same no matter the location of the parking.

For the rest as we depend on the other cars we will check the lasers to make sure not to crash.

After the time based movements we will want to make the car have the same orientation as the street, because that way our car is aligned with the others. So we align it backwards first until we are aligned or there is an obstacle 1 meter behind and if that is the case we try to do it forward until we are aligned or there is an obstacle 1 meter infront. We continue doing this until we are aligned.

```python
while not END_PARKING:
  END_PARKING = align_car_back_parking(street_orientation, 1)
  if END_PARKING:
    break
  END_PARKING = align_car_parking(street_orientation, 1)
```
