## Fitting the map

In order to make the transformation from Gazebo to the image we need to complete this equation.

![Matrix](coord2pix.png)

For the rotation part it was pretty clear that it was 90 degrees.

And as we only want the x and y values we obtain the following 2 equations, note that the scales are different because the image is not square (415x279). But as we have the size of the warehouse we can use that to get both of them.

```math
x' = (ty - y) * (map_width / warehouse_height)
```

```math
y' = (tx - x) * (map_height / warehouse_width)
```

Now to get the translations tx and ty we just move the robot to differents positions using the GUI to display it in the map. So the translations values are:

```math
tx = 6.8
```

```math
ty = 10.31
```

## Using ompl

In order to create the plan to go pick up the desired shelf we have to use the ompl library. So following the tutorials and with the code given as an example I was able to succesfully getting it to run. Here are the key details on it:

* To set the bounds I use the image size.
* Add the current pose as the start and the map coordinates of the shelf as the goal with a yaw that made the robot look away from the wall and aligned with the shelf.
* Set the optimization objective to be the length of the path

```python
pdef.setOptimizationObjective(ob.PathLengthOptimizationObjective(si))
```

* The planner I used is LazyPRMstar that can be defined as the lazy checking version of PRM

>PRM is a planner that constructs a roadmap of milestones that approximate the connectivity of the state space. The milestones are valid states in the state space. Near-by milestones are connected by valid motions. Finding a motion plan that connects two given states is reduced to a discrete search (this implementation uses A*) in the roadmap.

* To check if the state was valid I had to take into account the shape of the robot (width and length, not height) because it changed when picking up a shelf and also the rotation of the robot. This last part is really difficult to do it with the shelf on top, because its behavior cannot be controlled, if it always followed the robot yaw or did not rotate it would have prevented for the rare cases where the shelf crashes into an obstacle because the angle is not what the planner thinks.

## Lifting up a shelf

Lifting a shelf with the robot is simple, as long as the bug mentioned at the end does not happen. The robot is positioned in the middle of it and also aligned.

The problem now is that as the height has changed the robot no longer fits inside of the shelves as it used to do. To solve this I manually draw in the position of the shelves that are not being lifted as obstacles (paint black in my map representation, it can later be restored) so that the planner does not try to use a path that goes below one of them.

Finally I also need to remove the legs of where the shelf being lifted was, because if not the robot will be perpetually stuck. To achieve this I use the same method as above but instead of setting them as obstacles, I remove all the obstacles from that area (paint them white).

## Planning return

In this case to make things simpler I set the target to 0,0 but it can be set to wathever valid location on the map.

With the updated map and updated robot size to account for the shelf we can just use the same planning method as before. As I made everything parametrical and using classes I just need to change the size of the robot instance with the method from the robot class and call the planner.

## Bugs

The worst bug is the one seen in the video below. When the robot rotates in the same position with no linear velocity it keeps moving linearly little by little causing the robot to drift about 20 to 40 centimiters. This seems to be a bug with Gazebo so the only think that I can do is to pry that this does not matter when lifting a shelf, because if the robot is moved to far from the center of the shelf, it can glitch really badly causing it to not move the shelf or to crash with other shelves. Sadly this happens mostly on the first shelf, but can happen randomly in all of them.

Another annoying bug is that the shelf doesn't rotate with the robot, it rotates only around 33% (so you need to rotate the robot 3 times to make the shelf rotate once). The solutions to this problem explained above would be the best.

And for the end another bug that can be found in the video where the robot goes to the 6th shelf is that the robot after going in a straight line for a bit it tends to rotate a little bit. This can also happen with the robot completly stop before launching the simulation, if left for a while the robot can rotate 90ยบ and also move around 50 cm.
