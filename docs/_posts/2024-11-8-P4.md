## Fitting the map

In order to make the transformation from Gazebo to the image we need to complete this equation.

For the rotation part it was pretty clear that it was 90 degrees.

And as we only want the x and y values we obtain the following 2 equations, note that the scales are different because the image is not square (415x279). But as we have the size of the warehouse we can use that to get both of them.

```math
x' = (ty - y) * (map_width / warehouse_height)
```

```math
y' = (tx - x) * (map_height / warehouse_width)
```

Now to get the translations tx and ty we just move the robot to differents positions using the GUI to display it in the map. So the translations values are:

```math
tx = 6.8
```

```math
ty = 10.31
```
